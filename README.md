# Airline_Industry
## Airline_Industry Introduction
* The first airline to go international was PANAM
* Some of the 1st countries in Asia to embrace air transport were India, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines
* As per statistics of 2011, the us has 40% of the total shares of the airline industry
* IATA, ICAO, FAA, EASA, and DGCA are the major international governing bodies of the airline industry.

## Aircraft Classification
* Aircraft is a vehicle that fly by gaining support like dynamic lift of airfoil,downward thrust from jet engines, etc.
* Explain aircraft industry?
* Describe the lifrcycle of an aircraft?
* Classification of airline:- 1. Lift Type- Aerostats , Aerodynes 2. Propulsion-> Powered(propeller, jet aircraft, rotor craft) Unpowered(gliders)
## Aerostats

## Propeller Aircraft
* it is an aircraft where an airscrew spins on an axis aligned in the direction of travel to create thrust in a forward diretion
  
## Jet Aircraft
## Rotor Craft

* Four Forces on an Aircraft:-
* Weights - directed toward the center of the earth
* lift - to overcome the weight force, airplanes generate an opposing force called lift
* drag - air resists the motion of aircraft, directed along and opposed to the flight direction
* thrust - to overcome drag, airplanes use a propulsion system to generate a force called thrust
  
* Different types of aircraft motions:-
* basic motion - a combination of translation and rotation
* cruising - aircraft flies in a straight line at constant speed
* banking turn - gradual curved flight path
* gradual climb - airplane climbs whenever the lift is greater than the weight
* roll
* pitch
* yaw
  
* Underlying Principles:-
* The principle underlying the aircraft mechanism is Bernoulli principle(moving fluid is inversely proportional to thr speed of thr fluid)
  
* Lifecycle of the plane from pushback to parking:-
* 1, pushback and taxi out 2. take off and climb 3. cruise- power is reduced from the setting that was needed to climb and the aircraft maintains a consistent and level altitude 4. descent, landing, taxi in, parking
* Common units of measurement with respect to aircraft:-
* distance, fuel, speed, weight, height
* Different categories of aircraft weights:-
* payload, operating weight, zero fuel weight, ramp weight, brake release weight, take-off weight, landing weight

## Flight Operations
* Explain flight planning?
* Describe flight dispatch process?
  
* Flight operations refers to the work stream in an airline that is concerned with assisting the physical operation of an aircraft flight, the planning for such operations both in terms of logistics and the environmental aspects, coordination, monitoring and exceptional handling.
* Flights longer than 8 hours require 3 pilots(1 captain and 2 first officers) to rotate flying duties. Flight longer than 12 hours require 4 pilots(1 captain and 3 first officers)
* Flight planning is the process of producing a flight plan to describe a proposed aircraft flight. Flight planners normally wish to minimize flight costs by appropriate choice of route, height, and speed and by loading the minimum necessary fuel on board.
* Fuel calculation- eg1. flight planning requires accurate weather forecasts so that fuel consumption calculations can account for the fuel consumption effects of head or tail winds and air temperature.  eg2. safety regulations require aircraft to carry fuel beyond the minimum needed to fly from origin to destination, allowing for unforeseen circumstances or for diversion to another airport if the planned destination becomes unavailable.
* Compliance- compliance with air traffic control requirements is done to minimize the risk of mid-air collision.
* Takeoff Planning
* Aircraft must also carry some reserve fuel to allow for unforeseen circumstances, such as an inaccurate weather forecast or air traffic control requiring an aircraft to fly at a lower height than optimum due to congestion or some last-minute passengers whose weight were not allowed for when the flight plan was prepared.
* Flight Dispatch
* It refers to the activities that relate to facilitating the operation of a flight which include pre-planning, in-flight monitoring, and ensuring that each flight reaches its final destination in a safe and timely manner.
* Factors that affect the flight dispatch
* weather- (temp, wind direction, speed, barometric pressure)at the departure airport, along the route, at the dispatch airport, at the alternate airport
* Fuel- total fuel consumed, additional fuel, required fuel for holding, fuel to an alternate airport
* Aircraft- navigation limitations, max weight and balance limitations, performance
* Aircrew- meet req qualifications for flight, meet req currency standards, have adequate rest
* Fuel planning- weight limitations, manufacturer specified and actual, weather conditiond, payload, routing
*   ![alt text](C:\Users\DELL\Pictures\Screenshots\Screenshot (264).png)
*   Load Control- operating an airplane above max weight limitation compromises the structural integrity of the airplane and adversely affects its performance.
*   Communication in Flight Operation:- Airline and Station messaging and TWLU, APIS, FLIFO

  
## Crew Scheduling
* Explain crew scheduling?
* Describe the communications in flight operations?
* Explain movement control?

* Load Control- operating an airplane above max weight can adversely affect its performance.
* Communication in Flight Operation:- Airline and Station messaging and TWLU, APIS, FLIFO
* Crew Scheduling- It is a process where crew members are assigned duties which could include flying, ground, and or standby duties over a fixed period which be fortnightly, monthly, or quarterly.
* flying or cockpit - pilots who fly the aircraft
* captain - the pilot in command aasisted by first officer(co-pilot), crew that serve in the cabin of the sircraft, refereed to as stewards or hostesses
* while scheduling various factors taken in consideration :- government regulations, labour agreements, qualifications and licensing, bid requests.
* The crew scheduling:- Flight scheduling- timetable of flights , Fleet Assignment- it is decidec based on various factors such as the voulme of passengers travelling, the type of passengers, Aircraft Routing- decision to route a particular aircraft within a specified fleet type.
* Crew Rostering is the process of assigning individual crew members to crew pairings. The method that is followed in rostering is called the preferential bidding system.

                                           Personal Lines
 * Crew pairing is the assignment of crew to a sequence of flight legs, within the same fleet, that starts and ends at the same crew base
 * Cabin crew Regulation- there will be four-seven weeks in flight training
 * cockpit crew regulations-
 * new pilot qualification standards
 * Movemenet Control- The continuous monitoring of all flight movements originating from, terminating into or transisting via a station is called movement control.
 * Flights track, OOOI(out, off, on , in)
 * Air Traffic Control - it ensure safe operation of commercial and private aircraft
 * ATC PROCESSES 1.Preflight and takeoff, 2. Departure, En route, Descent, 3. Approach and landing
 * Departure Control SystemsIt is an automated system to control and record passenger flight check-in/ boarding , aircraft weight and balance.
 * IRE AND ACM - verification and updating of passenger and baggage upload data with reference to pnr
 * leading DCS in the industry are SITA CUTE and amaeus altea.
 * Features and functions of DCS
 * Standard feature- verifies reservation, checks in passengers, records additiona; passenger data, issues boarding/ bag tags, provides inter airline through check in, handles cod share flight by distingusing operating and marketing carrier
 * Functions- Facilitates operations / passengers data , allow immediate/deffered initialization, constructs flight check in records, allow setting of automatic numeric limits for acceptance based on PNL data
 * long haul- refers to more than 6 hrs of flying

## Airline Operations Control
* Explain airline operation
* Describe the message and event of flight operations
* Identify the various terms used in flight operations
* AOC- AIRLINES Operation control or OCC Operations control Center comprises of representatives from every section in the airline.
* it works 24*7 to ensure that every flight is available at the airport of departure. its major functionality is disruption management
* Mocc- Maintenance Operations control center- control aircraft maintenance activities
* SOCC- station operations control centers- it controls station resources(gates, refueling, catering, ramp handling and passenger handling facilities)

* Flight Operations:Events- Flights are schedule roughly six months prior to actual departure
* MVT message are associated with events generated out of aircraft movement in flight route
