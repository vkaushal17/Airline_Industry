# Airline_Industry
## Airline_Industry Introduction
* First airline to go international was PANAM

## Aircraft Classification
* Aircraft is vehicle that fly by gaining support like dynamic lift of airfoil,downward thrust from jet engines, etc.
* Explain aircraft industry?
* Describe the lifrcycle of an aircraft?
* Classification of airline:- 1. Lift Type- Aerostats , Aerodynes 2. Propulsion-> Powered(propeller, jet aircraft, rotor craft) Unpowered(gliders)
## Aerostats

## Propeller Aircraft
* it is an aircraft where an airscrew spins on an axis aligned in the direction of travel to create thrust in a forward diretion

## Jet Aircraft
## Rotor Craft

* Four Forces on an Aircraft:-
* Weights
* lift
* drag
* thrust
* Different types of aircraft motions:-
* basic motion
* cruising
* banking turn
* gradual climb
* roll
* pitch
* yaw
* Underlying Principles:-
* The principle underlying the aircraft mechanism is Bernoulli principle(moving fluid is inversely proportional to thr speed of thr fluid)
* Lifecycle of the plane from pushback to parking:-
* 1, pushback and taxi out 2. take off and climb 3. cruise 4. descent, landing, taxi in, parking
* Common units of measurement with respect to aircraft:-
* distance, fuel, speed, weight, height
* Different categories of aircraft weights:-
* payload, operating weight, zero fuel weight, ramp weight, brake release weight, take-off weight, landing weight
*
